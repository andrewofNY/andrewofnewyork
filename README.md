- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Andrew!
- By day, I work remotely as a Content Strategist for a B2B agency. But I'm working towards becoming a software developer.
- ğŸ‘€ I'm interested in software development and engineering, web3, and creating more power and privacy for users on the internet.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning learning full stack development and hope to get a job working in the industry soon.
